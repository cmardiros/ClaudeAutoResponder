# Technical Spike Investigation: VS Code Terminal Support Feasibility

## 1. INVESTIGATION SUMMARY
**Technical Question**: Can ClaudeAutoResponder eliminate context switching overhead by reliably operating within VS Code integrated terminals across multiple projects?
**Investigation Trigger**: Multi-project workflow with 3-4 simultaneous projects creates unsustainable cognitive load from terminal↔project mental mapping
**Expected Outcome**: Go/no-go decision with specific technical evidence for VS Code integration feasibility
**Timeline**: 1.5 days maximum - focused validation only

## 2. INVESTIGATION SCOPE
### Critical Path Technical Questions (Must Answer All)
**CQ-1**: **Background Detection Reliability** - Does VS Code expose terminal content via accessibility APIs when not focused/backgrounded?
**CQ-2**: **Multi-Terminal Targeting** - Can we reliably identify and target specific terminal tabs within a VS Code window?
**CQ-3**: **Prompt Detection Parity** - Do Claude Code prompts appear identically in VS Code terminal vs standalone terminals?
**CQ-4**: **Response Delivery Reliability** - Can existing MacOSKeystrokeSender deliver responses to correct VS Code terminal tab?

### Investigation Success Criteria
**BLOCKER TEST**: If any critical question fails, investigation stops - VS Code integration not viable

**CQ-1 Success**: Extract terminal content from backgrounded VS Code window containing Claude prompt
**CQ-2 Success**: Send keystrokes to specific terminal tab in multi-tab VS Code window
**CQ-3 Success**: Existing PromptParser detects Claude prompt in VS Code terminal text
**CQ-4 Success**: Complete prompt→response cycle in VS Code terminal matches standalone behavior

### Scope Boundaries
**In Scope**: Minimum technical validation for core workflow elimination
**Out of Scope**: Performance optimization, edge cases, VS Code extension development, cross-platform support

## 3. INVESTIGATION METHODOLOGY
### Rapid Validation Approach
**Hour 1-2**: Background Detection Test
- Test VS Code accessibility API exposure when backgrounded
- Validate terminal content extraction from unfocused VS Code

**Hour 3-4**: Multi-Terminal Targeting Test  
- Create multi-tab terminal setup in VS Code
- Test keystroke delivery to specific terminal tabs
- Validate tab identification reliability

**Hour 5-6**: Integration Compatibility Test
- Run existing PromptParser against VS Code terminal content
- Test complete Claude prompt→response cycle
- Compare behavior vs iTerm2/Terminal.app

**Hour 7-8**: Architecture Impact Assessment
- Identify exact code changes needed for VS Code bundle ID support
- Estimate integration complexity and maintenance burden

### Validation Tests
**Test 1**: Background Content Access
```bash
# VS Code backgrounded with Claude prompt in terminal
osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to tell process "Code" to get value of text area 1'
```

**Test 2**: Multi-Tab Targeting
```bash
# Multiple terminal tabs open, test targeting tab 2
swift MacOSKeystrokeSender 2 "test message"
# Verify correct tab receives input
```

**Test 3**: Prompt Detection Integration
- Generate Claude Code prompt in VS Code terminal
- Run existing PromptParser.swift against captured content
- Verify 100% detection accuracy

**Test 4**: Full Cycle Validation
- Complete Claude prompt→ClaudeAutoResponder→response cycle in VS Code
- Compare response delivery vs standalone terminal

## 4. INVESTIGATION PLAN
### Day 1 (6 hours)
**Morning (3 hours)**: Critical Question Validation
- Execute Tests 1-2 (background detection, multi-tab targeting)
- **STOP GATE**: If either fails, investigation ends with "not feasible" conclusion

**Afternoon (3 hours)**: Integration Validation
- Execute Tests 3-4 (prompt detection, full cycle)
- Document exact technical requirements and code changes

### Day 2 (2 hours) 
**Morning Only**: Architecture Analysis
- Map specific code changes needed for VS Code support
- Assess maintenance burden and complexity trade-offs

### Risk Mitigation
**Risk 1**: VS Code accessibility APIs insufficient → **Mitigation**: Test alternative automation approaches (30min max)
**Risk 2**: Multi-tab targeting unreliable → **Mitigation**: Evaluate if single-tab workflow acceptable (15min assessment)

## 5. DELIVERABLES
### Primary Deliverable
**Technical Feasibility Decision**: Clear GO/NO-GO with supporting evidence

### Supporting Documentation
**Critical Question Results**: Pass/fail for each CQ-1 through CQ-4 with technical evidence
**Integration Specification**: If feasible, exact code changes and effort estimate
**Blocker Documentation**: If not feasible, specific technical limitations preventing implementation

## 6. INVESTIGATION ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
**Scenario 1**: Full Feasibility Validation
- **GIVEN** VS Code with multi-tab terminal setup and Claude Code running
- **WHEN** all four critical questions tested successfully
- **THEN** GO decision documented with implementation specification
- **AND** effort estimate provided for integration work

**Scenario 2**: Technical Blocker Identification
- **GIVEN** any critical question fails validation
- **WHEN** blocker clearly identified and documented
- **THEN** NO-GO decision documented with specific technical limitations
- **AND** alternative approach recommendations if applicable

## 7. POST-INVESTIGATION TRANSITION
### Decision Outcomes
**GO Decision**: Proceed with implementation using documented specification
**NO-GO Decision**: Document limitations for user and consider workflow alternatives

### Implementation Readiness
**If Feasible**: Create implementation task with specific file changes and effort estimate
**If Not Feasible**: Document findings and recommend workflow optimization alternatives
